# CardGame
This is a small card game which shuffles a deck of 52 playing cards before retrieving a default of 5 random cards. The amount of cards retrieved can be changed and they'll be ordered from the highest value to the lowest.
The database which holds the details of the cards will migrate automatically when the application is run in the debugger, so you shouldn't need to manually run any migrations. The application is mobile responsive as well.
